# Creating a Simple Console-based Math Program

## Math Program 
version 0.1
NOTE: Created another version in C# to work with my children in understanding the difference with typed-languages

### Purpose:
TO create a program that allows my children to be able to learn programming and math!
Great and simple project for youngsters. They can really understand what's happening, even though it got a little long for them. 

### How it works:
Create your own math problems with up to 5 digits per set (2).
1. Choose your own number (up to 5 digits).
2. Choose another number (up to 5 digits).
3. Choose the mathematical operator to perform against the 2 numbers.
4. Choose whether you want to continue after playing.

### How to run the program: 
#### Requirements: 
UPDATED:
- Now the languages are in separate folders. So, far javascript and C#
JAVASCRIPT:
- Created with node v16.17.0. Not quite sure if it matters, but it was used to create a user input... readline to get user input from console.
- That's it
node mathProgram.js

C#
- Created with .net 6.0 and .net 8.0
- Change the schoolProgramming.csproj file to target the version you would prefer.
- 

### Future:
- Create the ability to retry a problem for a certain amount of attempts
- Create the ability to create more complex problems
- Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Try to create in a different language
