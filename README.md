# Creating a Simple Console-based Math Program

## Math Program 
version 0.1

### Purpose:
TO create a program that allows my children to be able to learn programming and math!

### How it works:
Create your own math problems with up to 5 digits per set (2).
1. Choose your own number (up to 5 digits).
2. Choose another number (up to 5 digits).
3. Choose the mathematical operator to perform against the 2 numbers.
4. Choose whether you want to continue after playing.


### Future:
- Create the ability to retry a problem for a certain amount of attempts
- Create the ability to create more complex problems
- Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Try to create in a different language
